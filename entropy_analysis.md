# Code Analysis

**Purpose:**
- This Python script compares the statistical properties of entropy data generated from two different sources:
    - OQS (Open Quantum Safe): A library for quantum-resistant cryptography.
    - Qrypt: A quantum-based random number generator API.
- The primary goal is to determine whether the entropy generated by these sources has comparable statistical properties, indicating potential suitability for use in cryptographic applications.

**Key Steps:**
1. **Fetches Entropy:** Retrieves entropy samples from both OQS and Qrypt.
2. **Performs Basic Statistics:** Calculates percentiles and entropy rates for each sample.
3. **Calculates Difference Scores:**
    - Hamming distance: Measures the number of differing bits between the samples.
        - Range: 0 to the length of the compared sequences (in bits).
    - Kolmogorov-Smirnov test: Assesses the similarity of their overall distributions.
        - Range: 0 to 1.
    - Jensen-Shannon divergence: Quantifies the difference between their probability distributions.
        - Range: Non-negative, typically between 0 and 1.
4. **Generates Markdown Report:** Creates this report to summarize the analysis and findings.
            
## Basic Statistics

**Understanding the Entropy Landscape**
- This section explain the fundamental characteristics of the generated entropy from OQS and Qrypt. I analyze
  their statistical distributions and information density to guage their suitability for cryptographic applications.
            
**Percentiles to Uneveil the Value Landscape**
- Percentiles offer a window into how entropy values are distributed within each sample. They reveal the typical values (50th percentile),
             as well as the range of values (25th and 75th percentiles). By comparing the percentiles of OQS and Qrypt, we can
             gain insights into their overall data spread and potential similarities or differences in value distribution.

**Entropy Rate to Assess Information Density**
- Entropy rate is a measure of the information density of a sequence. It is defined as the number of bits per byte. 
            High rates indicate strong randomness, making the data less predictable and more secure for cryptographic use.
            Examining the entropy rates of OQS and Qrypt can help us assess their effectiveness in generating high-quality,
            unprectable random numbers.            

## Percentiles (25th, 50th, 75th)
- OQS (25th, 50th, 75th percentile): [ 61.75 129.   194.25]
- Qrypt (25th, 50th, 75th percentile): [ 60.  126.5 189. ]

## Entropy Rate:
- **Bits per Byte:**
    - OQS: 8.0 
    - Qrypt: 8.0

Note: The length of each sequence is 1024 bytes. This translates to (1024 * 8 bits/byte) or 8192 bits for OQS and Qrypt.

## Test Results
**Test** | **Value** | **Interpretation**
---------|-----------|-----------------
Hamming distance | 4118 | Lower scores indicate greater similarity at the bit level. Range: 0 to the sequence length.
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p-value | 0.8689652815106905 | Higher p-values (typically above 0.05) suggest similar distributions. Range: 0 to 1.
Jensen-Shannon divergence | 0.3281993660289847 | Lower values indicate more similar probability distributions. Range: 0 to 1 (typically).

## Final Analysis:
**Thresholds for Comparability:**
- Hamming distance < 5000 
- Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p-value > 0.05 
- Jensen-Shannon divergence < 0.5 

# Conclusion:

    The results indicate that the entropy generated by OQS and Qrypt has comparable statistical properties, suggesting potential suitability for use in cryptographic applications.
